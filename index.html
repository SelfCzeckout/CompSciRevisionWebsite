						<h2>Computer Science</h2>
						<p><h3>What Board do we do?</h3> 
						-AQA, A Level code: A Level (7517)<br>
						The new A Levels in Computer Science are now "standalone" qualifications.
					
						<h3>What is Computer Science?</h3>
						Computer Science is a discipline which requires thinking both in abstract and
						in concrete terms. On a higher level, computer science is concerned with 
						problem-solving: modelling and analysing problems, designing solutions, and 
						implementing them. Problem-solving requires precision, creativity, and careful
						reasoning.<br>
	
						AS and A Level Computer Science, students learn the principles of computation and
						algorithms, computer programming, machine data representation, computer systems
						(hardware and software), computer organisation and architecture, communications
						and networking, databases and the consequences of using computing. The syllabus
						is taught in Python.

						<h3>Which subjects combine well with Computer Science? </h3>
						Computer Science has strong connections to many other disciplines. Mathematics,
						Further Mathematics, Physics, and Economics combine well with Computer Science.<br>
	
						Students who wish to study for a Computer Science degree should combine it with
						A Level Mathematics as this is a prerequisite at many universities.<br>

						<h3>What can Computer Science lead to? </h3>
						A good grade in Computer Science at A Level is valued by universities and
						employers since it requires the development of analytical thinking and problem
						solving skills. This course also lays an appropriate foundation for further study
						of Computer Science, Engineering, Physics or related subjects in higher education.
						Many problems in the sciences, engineering, health care, business and other areas
						can be solved effectively with computers, but finding a solution requires both
						computer science expertise and knowledge of the particular application domain.
						Thus, computer scientists often become proficient in other subjects.<br>

						<h3>A Level<br>
						A Level Paper 1 on-screen exam: 40% of the marks</h3>
	
						Students answer a series of short questions and write/adapt/extend programs in an 
						electronic answer document. This paper is in Python. This paper tests a student's
						programming ability, and theoretical knowledge of data structures, systematic problem
						solving, and the theory of computation.<br>
	
						<h3>A Level Paper 2 written exam: 40% of the marks</h3>
	
						This paper tests the fundamentals of data representation, computer systems (hardware
						and software), computer architecture and organisation, communications and networking,
						the consequences of using computing, databases and big data, and functional programming.<br>
	
						<h3>Non exam assessment: 20% of the marks</h3>
	
						This coursework unit assesses studentsâ€™ ability to use the knowledge and skills gained
						through the course to solve or investigate a practical problem.</p>

						<h2>Paper 1</h2>
						<p><h3>What's assessed:</h3>
						This paper tests a student's ability to program, as well as their theoretical
						knowledge of Computer Science from subject content 10-13 and the skills
						required from section 22 on the AQA website.
							
						<h3>Assessed</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>On-screen exam: 2 hours 30 minutes</li>
							<li>40% of A-level</li>							</ul>
							
						<h3>Questions</h3>
						Students answer a series of short questions and write/adapt/extend programs in
